Android Block Store Sample
===================================

This sample demonstrates how to use the Block Store API. The Block Store API allows your app to store user credentials that it can later retrieve to re-authenticate users on a new device. This sample demonstrates that by allowing you to save text, uninstall the app, reinstall it and retreive that text. 

Running the sample
-When you run the sample you will see a screen with an EditText and a button that says Sign In.
-To save text, type text into the EditText and press Sign In. There will now be a TextView displaying the text you just typed in.
-To test Block Store, uninstall the app and reinstall it. Your text will still be displayed in the TextView.
-To clear your text press Sign Out.
